## 5. Software Engineering Practices
The development of the Financial Data Explorer followed rigorous software engineering practices to ensure maintainability, scalability, and high-quality output.  

### üß™ 5.1 Testing and Test-Driven Development (TDD)  
Test-driven development was central to ensuring the reliability and robustness of the application. Following the TDD paradigm, test cases were written before implementation, which helped identify edge cases early and facilitated iterative development.  

#### Unit Testing  
Unit tests were implemented for all core functionalities, such as:  
- **Savings Growth Calculations**: Tests verified outputs for varying principal amounts, time periods, and interest rates.  
- **API Integration**: Mock responses were used to simulate FRED API data and validate the parsing logic.  

The Jest framework was chosen for its speed, ease of use, and support for mocking dependencies. For example, test cases were written to ensure that invalid inputs (e.g., negative savings amounts) returned appropriate error messages.  

> *"TDD provides an early warning system for errors, ensuring fewer bugs reach production"* (Beck, 2002). This was evident during the development of the ARIMA forecasting module, where early unit tests caught edge cases, such as missing data points in the API response.  

#### Integration Testing  
Integration tests were designed to ensure seamless communication between the following modules:  
- **Forecasting Module and API**: Ensured the ARIMA model processed API data correctly.  
- **Savings Calculator and Visualisations**: Verified that outputs displayed in graphs matched calculated values.  

Testing revealed issues with handling API rate limits, which were resolved by implementing a caching mechanism to reduce unnecessary requests.  

#### Stakeholder-Informed Testing  
Stakeholder feedback was incorporated into usability testing. For instance, initial tests identified confusion around input field validation, leading to the addition of real-time error messages and tooltips.  

**Challenges**: Writing comprehensive tests for dynamic modules like the ARIMA model required extra effort, but this significantly reduced debugging during integration.  

**Placeholder**: Insert a Jest test report showing pass/fail results.  

### üå± 5.2 Branches and Pull Requests  
GitHub was used extensively for version control, enabling collaborative workflows and maintaining a clean codebase.  

#### Feature Branching  
Each feature was developed in a separate branch (e.g., `feature-arima-forecasting`), adhering to a structured naming convention. This approach minimised conflicts and allowed for isolated development.  

#### Pull Requests and Code Reviews  
Pull requests included:  
- Detailed descriptions of changes.  
- Automated test results generated via GitHub Actions.  
- Reviewer comments to ensure code quality.  

For example, during the ARIMA implementation, the pull request included test logs, a changelog, and a summary of challenges encountered.  

**Placeholder**: Add a screenshot of a pull request with linked issues and test results.  

### üêû 5.3 Issue Tracking and Bug Management  
GitHub Issues were used to document and prioritise tasks, with labels such as Bug and Feature. Tasks were categorised by priority:  
- **P1 (High Priority)**: Essential tasks, such as API integration.  
- **P2 (Medium Priority)**: Non-critical enhancements, like adding tooltips.  

**Example**: A bug related to API rate limits was resolved by implementing retry logic and error handling for failed requests.  

**Placeholder**: Screenshot of a GitHub Issue card with detailed descriptions.

## 6. Ethical, Accessible, and Secure Development
The Financial Data Explorer ensured inclusivity, fairness, and security:  

- **Accessibility**: Designed to WCAG 2.1 standards, with keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, and high-contrast themes (World Wide Web Consortium, 2018). As Mace (1985) noted, *‚Äúaccessible design benefits all users, not just those with disabilities.‚Äù*  
- **Ethics**: Fully GDPR-compliant, with no personal data collected, protecting privacy (ICO, 2023). Forecasting models were free of bias, and outputs were transparently explained.  
- **Security**: Used environment variables to secure API keys, HTTPS protocols to encrypt data, and role-based access to restrict unauthorised actions.  

These measures ensured the application was inclusive, trustworthy, and secure.

## 8. Critical Reflection
This section evaluates the project‚Äôs success by examining its strengths, limitations, and key lessons learned.

### ‚úÖ 8.1 Strengths
1. **Technical Sophistication**  
   The integration of ARIMA models demonstrated an advanced understanding of time-series forecasting. ARIMA‚Äôs adaptability to non-seasonal data made it an ideal choice for short-term financial predictions (Hyndman and Athanasopoulos, 2018).

2. **User-Centric Design**  
   Accessibility features aligned with WCAG 2.1 standards ensured inclusivity. For example, ARIA labels and high-contrast themes catered to visually impaired users (World Wide Web Consortium, 2018).

3. **Professional Workflows**  
   Agile Kanban provided a flexible framework for task management, while GitHub Actions ensured CI pipelines maintained code quality. These practices align with Beck‚Äôs (2001) emphasis on iterative development and collaboration.

### ‚ùå 8.2 Limitations
1. **API Dependency**  
   The reliance on the FRED API introduced challenges, such as rate limits and potential downtime. While caching mitigated some issues, the system remains dependent on external data sources.

2. **Forecasting Complexity**  
   ARIMA performed well for short-term predictions but struggled with datasets containing seasonal patterns. Future iterations could explore SARIMA or machine learning models for improved accuracy (Hyndman et al., 2018).

3. **Time Constraints**  
   Some advanced features, like user-specific settings, were deprioritised due to limited development time.

### üí° 8.3 Lessons Learned
1. **Value of TDD**  
   Even though it can take time and can feel painful, writing tests before implementation reduced debugging time overall significantly. As Beck (2002) highlights, *‚ÄúTDD ensures cleaner code by preventing issues from the outset.‚Äù*

2. **Importance of Accessibility**  
   Iterative testing with tools like Lighthouse revealed critical accessibility issues that were resolved before deployment. This experience reinforced the importance of prioritising inclusivity in design (Mace, 1985).

3. **Value of Following Best Practices for Software Engineering**  
   The learning curve for this task was steep but rewarding. Even though the overall process of following best practice and not cutting corners adds a lot more time, it allows for very clear, accountable, and effective code and development.

### üí° 8.4 Recommendations for Future Development
- **Pre-Commit Hooks and Linting**: Implement tools like ESLint or Prettier to enforce coding standards automatically before committing. As Fowler (1999) notes, *‚Äúclean code reduces technical debt and ensures maintainability.‚Äù*  
- **Enhanced CI/CD Pipelines**: Integrate static code analysis and vulnerability scanning tools (e.g., SonarQube), which OWASP (2023) recommends for identifying security flaws early.  
- **Mutation Testing**: Use tools like Stryker to evaluate test suite robustness by simulating code changes. Beck (2002) highlights that *‚Äústrong testing increases confidence in software reliability.‚Äù*  
- **Automated Documentation**: Generate consistent technical documentation with tools like JSDoc to reduce manual effort and streamline onboarding (World Wide Web Consortium, 2018).
